### Project Description
The Fading Notepad app is a simple, aesthetically designed notepad where text gradually fades away after a set time, making it ideal for quick, disposable notes.

### the problem & solution
‚ÄúNotexist‚Äù is a mobile application developed in Flutter, designed to offer users a temporary notepad experience where typed notes gradually fade away. The app provides a simple, visually appealing interface styled like a classic notebook, with a curved rectangular text box where notes appear, making it both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Users can enter text into the provided TextField, and after a set delay, the text starts to fade, simulating the fleeting nature of a scratchpad. After fading out, the text clears automatically. Additionally, a floating action button labeled ‚ÄúUpload Text‚Äù serves as a reset function, presenting users with a ‚ÄúGoodbye‚Äù message and a dialog for confirmation before taking them to a fresh notepad.

To set up and use Fading Notepad, make sure Flutter is installed on your system. Place the necessary files, including the main.dart, assets, and pubspec.yaml in a single project directory. For the background image, ensure the path assets/notebook_background.png is added to the pubspec.yaml under assets, with the image located in an assets folder in your project directory. After setup, open a terminal in the project directory and use flutter run or run the app from an IDE like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.

Future enhancements for Fading Notepad could include options to save or archive notes temporarily before they disappear, the ability to switch between different notebook backgrounds for a personalized experience, and a share feature allowing users to quickly share their notes before they fade. This project offers a unique, playful approach to managing quick notes and provides a great opportunity for Flutter learners to practice using widgets, animations, and state management.
